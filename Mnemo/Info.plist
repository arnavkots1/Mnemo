	<!-- Privacy Usage Descriptions -->
	<!-- Location: Required for passive context logging of visits and location changes -->
	<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo needs location access to log where you were and create contextual memories. This helps build your personal timeline. All location data is stored locally on your device.</string>
	
	<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo needs "Always" location access to log location visits even when the app is in the background. This enables automatic memory creation as you move through your day. All data is stored locally and you can disable this anytime in Settings.</string>
	
	<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo needs "Always" location access to log location visits even when the app is in the background. This enables automatic memory creation as you move through your day. All data is stored locally and you can disable this anytime in Settings.</string>
	
	<!-- Microphone: Only used during explicit Emotional Capture Sessions -->
	<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo needs microphone access only during Emotional Capture Sessions that you explicitly start. These sessions are foreground-only and clearly indicated in the app. The microphone is never used secretly or in the background. Audio is processed on-device and can be deleted anytime.</string>
	
	<!-- Speech Recognition: For transcribing emotional moments -->
	<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo uses speech recognition to transcribe audio during Emotional Capture Sessions, helping you remember what was said during emotional moments. This only happens during explicit sessions you start, never in the background.</string>
	
	<!-- Motion: For activity classification (walking, stationary, etc.) -->
	<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo uses motion activity to understand what you were doing (walking, stationary, in a vehicle) to enrich your location-based memories. This helps create more meaningful context entries. Motion data is processed on-device and stored locally.</string>
	
	<!-- Calendar: Optional enrichment of memories with event titles -->
	<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo can optionally enrich your memories with calendar event titles when you're at a location during an event. This is completely optional and you can disable it in Settings. Calendar data is only read, never modified.</string>
	
	<!-- Photo Library: For importing user-selected photos only -->
	<!-- Note: We use PHPickerViewController with scoped access, so this may not be needed -->
	<!-- But including it for compatibility -->
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo needs photo library access to save photos you select as moments. We only access photos you explicitly choose—we never scan your entire photo library.</string>
	
	<!-- Photo Library Usage (for reading selected photos) -->
	<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
	<string>Mnemo needs photo library access to import photos you select as moments. We only access photos you explicitly choose via the photo picker—we never scan your entire photo library.</string>
